The sentences are short and mainly consist of subject-verb-object structures, which is typical of A1-level language production.\\n- **Lack of complex connectors:** The text does not demonstrate the use of complex connectors like \"because,\" \"although,\" or \"despite,\" which are characteristic of higher-level language production. The only connector used is \"and,\" which is a basic connector.\\n- **No abstract or complex ideas:** The content of the text is concrete and practical, focusing on specific items to be purchased. There are no abstract concepts, complex arguments, or detailed descriptions, which would be expected in higher-level writing (e.g., B1, B2, or C1).\\n- **Limited'"
